# Data model

## Folder structure
This document describes the data model used by the application.The tool is designed to be flexible and allow the user to
define the data model. Thus, the folder structures is defined in a hierarchical way. First the industry is defined, then
the process and finally the method. This can be seen in the following figure.
```
├── idr_iisim
    ├── industry
        ├── processA
            ├── method1
                ├── model.png
                ├── model.py
                ├── model.yaml
            ├── method2
                ├── model.py
                ├── model.yaml
        .
        .
        .
...
```

The user can create as many industries, processes and methods as needed. The only requirement is that the methods must
be defined in a folder with the name of the method. The folder must contain a model.py file with the model definition
and a model.yaml file with the model parameters. The model.png file will be automatically generated by the tool.

The `model.py` is the same for all methods. It contains a class that inherits all its methods from the `Model` class
defined [here](../idr_iisim/models/model.py).

## Model parameters
The model parameters are defined in the `model.yaml` file. [Here](../config/model_template.yaml) you can see a template 
of the file. Please check this template carefully and make sure that all the required parameters are defined.
